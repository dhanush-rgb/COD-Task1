## overview of the project
### project: TO DO LIST
### Structure:

**HTML:** The code defines the basic layout of the web page using HTML. It includes:
A header with the title "To Do List" and a link to include Font Awesome icons
A footer with a link to the developer's GitHub profile.                                       
**CSS:** The code includes a link to Bootstrap's CSS framework (style.css) for styling the elements. 
                                                                                                      **JavaScript:** The code includes a link to a JavaScript file (script2.js) that handles the functionality of the To-Do List.
                                                                                                      
### Functionality:

**Adding Tasks:**
The "Add New Task" section includes a form with an input field to type in a task and a button to submit it.
The JavaScript code in script2.js handles submitting the form, storing the task, and displaying it in the To-Do List.                                                                        
**Deleting Tasks:**
Each task has a "Delete" button (represented by the Font Awesome icon "fa-times").
When clicked, the JavaScript code removes the corresponding task from the list and updates the local storage.                                                                            
**Checking Off Tasks:**
Each task has a "Check" button (represented by the Font Awesome icon "fa-check").
When clicked, the task is marked as completed, and its text is crossed out.               
**Deleting All Tasks:**
A "Delete All" button at the top of the list allows the user to clear all tasks.        
**Subtasks:**
Tasks can have subtasks. A subtask input area appears when a main task is expanded.
The JavaScript code manages adding, deleting, and checking off subtasks.

### **Overall:**

This project is a simple yet functional To-Do List web application. It leverages the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Bootstrap for styling, to create a user-friendly interface for managing tasks. The local storage functionality allows the application to save the tasks across browser sessions, so the user doesn't have to re-enter them every time they use the application.
